Jamie Maclaren scored twice to star in Mohun Bagan Super Giant’s 3-0 win over
Punjab FC in an ISL match at the Salt Lake Stadium here on Wednesday and
improved its chances of retaining the League Shield.

Liston Colaco scored the other goal as the home team took its tally to 46
points from 20 matches and opened up a 12-point lead over second-placed
Jamshedpur FC, which has played two matches less.

The opening half did not see much action as Bagan struggled to open up space
against the tight defence of the Punjab side. Greg Stewart had a chance in the
10th minute but his right-footed effort was nicely tipped over by Ravi Kumar.

Mohun Bagan continued to show its offensive intent with regular incursions
inside the Punjab box but the visitor’s defence somehow held firm.

The match came alive in the 55th minute when Punjab launched a counter-attack
and saw its play-maker Pula Vidal moving into the Bagan box. His accurate
cross found Petros Giakoumakis unmarked on the Bagan goalmouth, but the Greek
forward found his attempt coming off the upright.

This seemed to bring Mohun Bagan out of its slumber and the host took the lead
in the very next minute (56th minute) to set itself on the victory path.
Maclaren, assisted by a cross from Dipendu Biswas, broke the deadlock with a
nice finish.

Colaco doubled the lead in the 63rd minute from a fine solo effort before
Maclaren completed the tally with his second in the 90th minute.

**The result:** Mohun Bagan 3 (Maclaren 56, 90, Colaco 63) bt Punjab FC 0.
